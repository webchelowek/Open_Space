<h5>Description</h5>

<p>You have a control deck, but it looks a bit simplistic, so let's work on the looks!</p>

<p>You are free to start from one of the two separate parts of the stage: customizing the input elements or creating a border for the panel.</p>

<p>To create a multicolor border, we wrapped all the content of the control-panel element just like in the scheme below and set the gradient background to the outer element:</p>

<p>There is just so much to do when it comes to decorating: you can create a whole variety of visual effects by setting gradients; if you are interested, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://projects.verou.me/css3patterns/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Lea Verou's patterns gallery</a>. We decided to make a simple warning border, but you can implement a different theme.</p>

<p>It's important for a web developer to know how to customize standard HTML elements: you don't want to create something that looks like a website from the very first days of the Internet. Customize the password field, the password submission button, and the rocket launch button.</p>

<p>For testing purposes, we listed several crucial points in the objectives, but you can add whatever you want, for example, change the font or the text color, set a border, etc.</p>

<p>Last but not least, don't forget to set the margins to make your panel nice and neat.</p>

<p>To preview your intermediate solution hover the mouse pointer over the HTML code to show the browser icons popup, and click the icon that indicates the desired browser. Alternatively, select <strong>View | Open in Browser </strong>from the main menu and then select the desired browser from the list. </p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<p>1.<span style="color: #66cc66;"> </span>Move the contents of the element with the class <code class="java">control-panel</code> to a new element with the class <code class="java">control-panel__inner</code>.</p>

<p>2. Set a gradient background to the control panel.</p>

<p>3. Change the text and the border of the password field.</p>

<p>4. Change the background color of the "ok" and "launch" buttons.</p>

<p>5. Change the shape of the "launch" button.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>In a browser, the result of this step should look something like this:</p>
