<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Welcome aboard! We surfed the web and found some pictures that you can use in your project: deep space for the background, a planet with lots of volcanoes, and a rocket. Your task is to organize all these pieces into one big picture. Follow the scheme, keep to the suggested class names, and you'll easily get the work done!</p>

<p>Here's some helpful advice:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Pay attention to the rocket element: most probably, you'll need to rotate it a bit to position it on the planet.</li>
	<li>If you're having trouble placing some element where it needs to be and you can't figure out why, try to set negative values to the properties like <code class="java">left</code> and <code class="java">bottom</code>.</li>
	<li>If you want to hide the bottom of the planet a bit, position the bottom a little below the space area and use the CSS property <code class="java">overflow: hidden</code> to hide everything that is out of the frame.</li>
</ol>
