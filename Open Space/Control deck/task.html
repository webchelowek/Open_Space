<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Well done: the setup looks fantastic! Now, it's time to build the control deck for our rocket.</p>

<p>We suggest taking some safety precautions, specifically, make a control panel that is protected by a password. The panel should contain two blocks of controllers and a big launch button. In this project, the controllers won't actually change the trajectory of the rocket, but after completing all the stages, you can easily customize the function of these controls if you wish.</p>

<p>Let's start by implementing the HTML part according to the suggested scheme:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/60fb1751-3727-47a8-ac5a-a826b66eaad9/"></p>

<p>Note that each element with a border is <code class="java">&lt;input/&gt;</code>. Also, remember that there are several different types of inputs: your choice should be based on the resulting page example we provided below. </p>

<p>Position your panel and set the background color: it can be any color you like.</p>

<p>Now, position the elements for the rocket engine management. Use your expertise and experience from the first stage to make the ranges vertical. Put the elements in place by setting the <code class="java">flex</code> property.</p>

<p>To preview your intermediate solution hover the mouse pointer over the HTML code to show the browser icons popup, and click the icon that indicates the desired browser. Alternatively, select <strong>View | Open in Browser </strong>from the main menu and then select the desired browser from the list. </p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<p>1. Implement the given scheme using the appropriate types of input fields.</p>

<p>2. Set the background to the panel.</p>

<p>3. Inputs in the sections "check-buttons" and "levers" should be positioned.</p>

<p>4. Each lever should be vertical.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>In a browser, the result of this step should look something like this:</p>
